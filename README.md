# Lip reading using Machine learning.

# Objective
The lip reading project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of interpreting speech by visually analyzing the movements of the lips. This technique can be particularly useful for enhancing speech understanding in noisy environments or for individuals with hearing impairments.
